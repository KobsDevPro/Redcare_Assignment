                                        **RedCare Pharmacy Assignment**  
    Please go through the HELP.md file in the code base to check installation guide and API urls. I have provided some information about the assignment as per my perspective. Please have a look.
**Benefits of my Design:**
● For this assignment I have chosen Java as a programming language as I have several years of expertise in java.
● Spring framework is being followed here for below reasons-
  1. Quickandsafeenvironmentconfigurationforsoftwaredevelopment.
  2. Reducescodelengthandsimplifiesthedevelopmentprocessbyutilizing
  annotations for more straightforward code understanding.
  3. FacilitatesthecreationandtestingofJava-basedapplicationsbyprovidinga
  default setup for unit and integration tests.
  4. TherearemanymorefacilitiesofspringbootbutIconsideredthesepointsformy
development process.
● Rest APIs are being used because -
  1. ItislightweightanditcanreceiveandreturndataformatsasXML,JSONor even parameter based arguments.
  2. Itisclientandserverindependent.Inotherwords,theRESTprotocolseparates the data storage and the UI from the server.
  3. Itisscalableandflexible.Soanymodificationinfuturewillbeeasyand understandable.
**Improvement Potential**
  ● As of now these APIs can only accept the mentioned data types in the controllers. I
  can introduce some validations which will validate and return proper error messages as an output.
  ● Add some Authentication and Authorization mechanisms.
  ● For development/production deployment I can prepare the jenkins pipeline when it is required.
  ● Add Sonar and Fortify scans for this code and resolve the issues indicated by that.
  ●Swagger for API documentation.

**Conclusion**
    I have done this assignment as per the problem statement provided. It was a very good and effective experience to brush up my technical knowledge. I have made the easiest possible design and development for this task. Please let me know if you have any query regarding my work.
